<div id="about">
    After seeing so many headlines about the tragedy that the people of Puerto Rico are facing today due to the effects of Hurricane Maria, we felt like something had to be done. Surely, most of us want to help in whatever way we can. In most cases, going to PR and lending a hand is very difficult for the average person as well as donating money. So we thought up of a way to raise money (and continuously!) to help these people in need with the advent of a digital currency known as Monero.

        The funds collected will be stored into a digital wallet and All the proceeds will go to United for Puerto Rico, an initiative brought forth by the First Lady of Puerto Rico, Beatriz Rosselló in collaboration with the private sector, with the purpose of providing aid and support to those affected in Puerto Rico by the passage of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane María.
